title: 23 Things I Learned About Writing, Strategy And Life From Isaac Morehouse
permalink: /isaac/
excerpt: I first met Tim Ferriss in 2007. I hesitate to say he was “just a guy then,” but he was and I was even less of a guy (I was another guy’s assistant and couldn’t legally buy a drink). Within a few months, Tim would go on to publish one of the biggest business books of the last decade and segue it into investments in Uber, Twitter, Facebook and WordPress. Whether you’re a fan of his writing or not, that’s an objectively impressive accomplishment.

<p class="intro">Howdy. My name is Matthew Mullenweg. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I write code, prose, and music. I love <a href="https://ma.tt/gallery/">taking photos</a>.</p>



<h3><b>WordPress</b></h3>



<p>I am a founding developer of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, the Open Source software used by over 31% of the web, including this site. The website says WordPress is “a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform” but more importantly WordPress is a part of who I am. Like eating, breathing, music, I can’t not work on WordPress. We celebrated <a href="https://ma.tt/2018/05/wordpress-at-15/">15 years of WordPress in 2018</a>. (I was 19 when I started. I’m 34 now.) The project touches a lot of people, something I’ve recently begun to appreciate. I consider myself very lucky to be able to work on something I love so much.</p>



<p>Every year I give a “State of the Word” speech. <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/04/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2017/">Here’s the 2017 edition</a>.</p>



<h3><b>Professional</b></h3>



<p>I used to do consulting and go to school in Houston, then I <a href="https://ma.tt/2004/10/28/press-and-cnet/">moved to San Francisco</a> where I worked at <a href="http://www.cnet.com/aboutcnet/">CNET Networks</a>. I left in late 2005 to found a company called <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, which is now the force behind <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, <a href="https://jetpack.com/">Jetpack</a>, <a href="https://woocommerce.com">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>, <a href="https://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>, <a href="https://magazine.atavist.com/">The Atavist</a>, and many other <a href="https://automattic.com/">products</a>. Our mission is to make the web a better place.</p>



<p>Though Automattic is my main focus I also advise and invest in startups through my company <a href="http://audrey.co/">Audrey Capital</a>. You can peruse the portfolio of companies <a href="http://audrey.co/">on the Audrey site</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Distributed Work</b></h3>



<p>Much like WordPress sought to change the way we publish on the web, Automattic has set out to change the way we work. We are an entirely distributed company — with more than 1,100 employees working from more than 62 countries, and no physical headquarters. We are a company that works on, and for, the web. <a href="https://distributed.blog/">I run a podcast and website about this at Distributed.blog</a>.</p>



<h3><b>Causes</b></h3>



<p>These are the charities or organizations that I support in a way that is significant to me. Some are working on basic survival issues, and some are addressing problems that we’re lucky to have in this modern technological age, but all are important to me: <a href="http://archive.org/">Archive.org</a>, <a href="http://www.alaskawild.org/">Alaska Wilderness League</a>, <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, <a href="http://thebaylights.org/">Bay Lights</a>, <a href="http://charitywater.org/">charity: water</a>, <a href="http://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, <a href="http://grist.org/">Grist</a> (board), <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/">Innocence Project</a>, <a href="http://longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.rothkochapel.org/">Rothko Chapel</a>, <a href="http://samasource.org">Samasource</a>, <a href="http://www.us-irelandalliance.org/">US-Ireland Alliance</a>.</p>

Awesomely creative think-piece. 40 very short fictional stories about what happens when you die. The framework is inspiring for anyone: coming up with 40 different answers to any one question. But theyâ€™re also just brilliant ideas and powerful little fables. I just read it a 2nd time and love it even more now.

<h2 id="my-review-">Review</h2>

<p><em>What’s the Big Deal About Bitcoin?</em> is the book to read if you want an introduction to what Bitcoin was meant to be and could be. You don’t need a deep technical background or an understanding of economics. Patterson explains important concepts in Bitcoin in a simple way that anyone can understand but that also doesn’t leave out any essentials.</p>

<p>He also covers some of the common objections, like the idea of “intrinsic value” or “bad people have used Bitcoin,” and thoroughly discredits them. You’ll have a better time arguing at Thanksgiving Dinner with your baby-boomer uncle!</p>

<p>My only issue real with this book today is that it hasn’t been updated for several years and doesn’t cover the takeover of BTC, the scaling debates over the block size, and the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV forks. It’s my own opinion that the Bitcoin Patterson describes in the book no longer exists in BTC. Readers might be confused about what Bitcoin they should choose — BTC or BCH or BSV.</p>

<p>Reading it now, Patterson might be too optimistic in the book that the scaling challenges in Bitcoin will be solved, or that Bitcoin can’t be taken over by ideaologies opposed to its original vision. But he couldn’t have known that at the time I think.</p>

<p>That said, you still can’t ask for a better introduction to Bitcoin, how it works, the economics, and why it has so much potential. I hope Patterson updates it in the future because I think that will round out an overall wonderful book.</p>

<h2 id="my-favorite-quotes-">My Favorite Quotes</h2>

<p>1. “Bitcoin was not created in isolation. It was created within a larger context to
fix a particular problem: modern payment systems are not suited for
the internet.</p>

<p>We can easily send emails and files across the web, but we can’t
easily send a few dollars. We have to go through middlemen, using
credit cards which are insecure and charge fees, bank transfers which
are slow and expensive, or services like Western Union which take big
percentage cuts of everything we send.”</p>

<p>2. “Traditional payment methods are not secure. Think about our current system: every time you hand your
credit card to somebody, they immediately hold all the information
needed to spend money on your behalf. Forever.”</p>

<p>3. “…modern currencies have a consistent
track record of losing value due to inflation. Whoever controls the
issuance of money tends to create too much. It’s not uncommon for
currencies to be completely destroyed by inflation in a matter of
decades.”</p>

<p>4. “Bitcoin… is meant to be the equivalent of digital cash – a fast, easy, “peer-to-peer” payment system, meaning the
sender and receiver exchange directly with each other. Paying in
bitcoin is akin to personally handing somebody cash, without requiring any middlemen.”</p>

<p>5. “Bitcoin, being
digital cash, is the first trustless payment system. It doesn’t require
third parties handling your financial data, and it uses its own currency to eliminate the possibility of arbitrary inflation.”</p>

<p>6. “…whenever you hear “blockchain,” we’re talking
specifically about the public online ledger which records all bitcoin
transactions…</p>

<p>7. “Unlike every other ledger in existence, the blockchain does not
reside in one place. It’s not stored on one server. The blockchain is
found on every single computer running the Bitcoin software.”</p>

<p>8. “Ownership of bitcoin is not murky. If the
ledger says you own bitcoin, you do. You can mathematically prove it.”</p>

<p>9. “It’s reasonable to say that a bitcoin transaction, once verified and added to
the ledger, is the most secure and certain piece of digital data in
existence. It is permanently unalterable by anyone, thanks to a use of
applied mathematics.”</p>

<p>10. “Bitcoin mirrors gold in some ways and improves on it in others.
While gold has been successful as a currency, it has some drawbacks.
For one thing, it’s clunky. Try paying for a pack of gum in gold
shavings, or for a house in gold bricks. Even worse, try using gold for
international business or on the internet. The idea of shipping
physical metal through the mail to trade internationally seems
archaic, and you can’t transmit gold bits through a phone line.”</p>

<p>11. “Bitcoins are not literally stored on your hard drive or phone.
They are stored in the blockchain itself. If bitcoin is like gold, the
blockchain is the gold vault.”</p>

<p>12. “Bitcoin is considered a “push system”, rather than a “pull system.” Meaning,
spending bitcoin requires funds to be intentionally “pushed” out of
the address, as opposed to a credit card or checking system where 
merchants can “pull” money out of your account once you give them
your information.”</p>

<p>13. “With bitcoin, there are no chargebacks. When you receive
bitcoin, it’s an irreversible transaction. Merchants receive digital cash
that was “pushed” to them from their customer. This reduces overhead costs for companies and will reduce prices for consumers.”</p>

<p>14. “The process of mathematically verifying that new transactions are
legitimate takes a large amount of computer power and energy. So,
when computers undertake this process, they are rewarded with a
small amount of new bitcoin.”</p>

<p>15. “Bitcoin allows for seamless remittances, instantly,
for almost no cost, and without any interference from middle men.
Companies like Western Union would have virtually no comparative
advantage to offer workers sending remittances directly back to their
families in bitcoin.”</p>

<p>16. “…units on the ledger can be assigned
to real-world goods. Meaning, ownership of a real-world good can be
transmitted and tracked on the public ledger as securely as a bitcoin.”</p>

<p>17. “Recording ownership on the public ledger
means you can change ownership of any good instantly, internationally, and without involving a bunch of lawyers.”</p>

<p>18. “Think
your neighbor stole your lawn mower? You can imagine a world
where disputes over ownership can be easily resolved by referring to
the global blockchain.”</p>

<p>19. “…bitcoin might be the most portable currency ever. You can carry an unlimited amount with you on your phone, on a laptop, on a flash
drive, or even on the web. Remember, owning a bitcoin doesn’t come
with any physical possession…”</p>

<p>20. “…bitcoin could
become a kind of standard for international trade that wouldn’t rely
on the politics and good governance of any particular nation.”</p>

<p>21. “At some point, people will neither understand nor care to understand the protocol. If it works,
that’s what matters.”</p>

<p>22. “…bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Neither does anything else.”</p>

<p>23. “Small-scale
transactions are usually safe even with zero confirmations.”</p>

<h2 id="my-notes-">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>3% transation fees with the traditional payment system sound small when you’re buying a cup of coffee. But add that up over time, or consider 3% of large, enterprise transactions. Bitcoin can solve all of that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Bitcoin is modeled on gold, it’s not limited by gold. It improves on gold’s shortcomings—portability, transaction speed, and security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steve suggests that checks and balances exist to prevent the Core developers from doing things that are malicious, greedy or stupid…Unfortunately I’m not sure how well those checks worked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By it’s nature, Bitcoin has some user experience advantages. I don’t need to drive to a Western Union to wire money internationally, I can just send Bitcoin. I don’t need to get my ID and sign up for a bank account. I can download an iPhone app or run software on a computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine a world where keys were all that needed to be exchanged for ownership transactions. No more paperwork, no more bureacracy. Just keys between two parties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you had bought Bitcoin when Steve wrote this book ($300), well….</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Bitcoin is not wellsuited for transactions involving only a few cents at a time.” Disagree. BTC is inefficient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bitcoin gets its value from its uses, not just speculation or hoarding. It can be used to track the legitimate ownership of any asset on the planet and transfer it quickly to
anybody. It is transparent bookkeeping for the globe, accessible to everybody. It’s scarce. It’s set in stone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steve writes: “Practically all of the
new development, too, is being focused on the bitcoin blockchain.” How things have changed in a few years! Small blocks crippled a lot of the interesting developments. We’ll see if things change. Until then, big blocks in BSV or BCH seem to be the best choice.</p>

<p>This blog is not primarily financially driven. I put it up in 2007 to build a community and learn from smart readers.</p>



<p>Regardless, beginning December 1, 2009, the <a href="http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2009/12/01/were_bloggers____we_get_stuff_for_free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTC requires bloggers</a> to disclose whenever there could be hidden interests or unspoken biases related to recommendations. &nbsp;So here goesâ€¦</p>



<p><strong>First, the obvious:</strong> I am a tech investor and advisor. Here are <a href="https://angel.co/tim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most of the start-ups</a> I work with.</p>



<p><strong>Second, the less obvious:</strong> Per the FTC rules, if I interview someone and they grab the bill for lunch, I would need to disclose this. Ditto if I use an Amazon link that gets me 8 cents instead of an Amazon link that gets me 0 cents. If someone gives me a comfy t-shirt with a logo and I wear it in a photo, same deal. Disclaimers all over the place. This would be tedious for me and even more tedious for readers. But rules is rules. To cover my ass and preserve your reading experience, please assume that, for every link and product I use, the following all hold true:</p>
